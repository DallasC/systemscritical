# One System Operational
An entry for the GMTK 2019 game jam with the theme "only one"

## Summary
You play as a damaged space ship with only enough power left to run 1 sub-system at a time. 

Your goal is to navigate the astroid field and travel through the purple wormholes.

You can switch between different systems with 1,2,3:
1. Engines: Press W to move forward 
2. Wepons: Press W to shoot things 
3. Radar: Press W to activate radar to see astroids
You can use A and D to turn left and right at any time.

What this means is that if you want to see astroids/where you should go you can use the radar system but won't be able to move or shoot.

Like wise if you want to shoot astroids you can use the wepon system but you won't be able to move/see.

Lastly if you want to move you won't be able to see/shoot.

## Post mortom
The goal was for the player to be making a great escape in a damaged ship through an astroid field while being chased by hostile enemy ships. 

Unfortunately being a solo developer with other things going on and the event being only 2 days, I wasn't able to finish everything that I wanted.

The main thing that I ran out of time to do was getting the enemy ship AI working. I had a basic version completed but it didn't attempt to dodge astroids and it was only 1 type of enemy ship. I opted not to include it in the finial game because I felt that it made the game feel more sloppy than without.

I also wanted to design larger levels to play but had to settle for a basic astroids game like level with randomly generated astroids.

Lastly I didn't have time to add better menu's and game ending screen which would have made the game feel more polished.

Maybe someday I'll finish it up and add the enemy ships to the game.
